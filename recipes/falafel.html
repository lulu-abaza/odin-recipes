  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This is a tasty dense falafel that contains no eggs. Serve on pitas with tzatziki or tahini sauce with lettuce and
    tomato.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> 1 (19 ounce) can garbanzo beans, rinsed and drained</li>
    <li> 1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li> 2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li> 1 ½ tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
    </li>
    <li> 1 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
    <li> ⅛ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
    <li> ½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li> 1 cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
    <li> ¾ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li> ¼ teaspoon cracked black peppercorns </li>
    <li> 1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Mash the garbanzo beans in a large bowl. Stir in the onion, garlic, cilantro, parsley, cumin, turmeric, baking
      powder, bread crumbs, salt and pepper. Do not be afraid to use your hands. Shape the mixture into 1 1/2 inch
      balls; you should get 18 to 24. If the mixture does not hold together, add a little water.
    </li>
    <li>
      Heat the oil in a deep fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Carefully drop the balls into the hot oil, and fry
      until brown. If you do not have a deep fryer, heat the oil in a heavy deep skillet over medium-high heat. You may
      need to adjust the heat slightly after the first couple of falafels, and be sure to turn frequently so they brown
      evenly. </li>
  </ol>
